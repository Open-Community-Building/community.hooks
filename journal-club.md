# Journal Club

Every Thursday, we are going to have a journal club, lead by students.

Probably from 17:00 to 18:00 at the Tink Tank.

They are going collect papers on Zotero:

https://www.zotero.org

- Everyone can consult this list and vote
- Two to three people present each week
- The presenter will present a paper that they know really well, and it should be on a topic that they are very interested in.
- We can also discuss a paper that we find very important in our field and someone takes the responsibility to present it
- There should be a break of 2 months until the same person presents again
- The group will be rather heterogeneous so we have to make sure everyone can take away something interesting from the talks
- The recommendation was to setup a Research gate watch list and use google alerts

The current organiser is going to be Rishabh Kumar: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabh-kumar-61685a193
