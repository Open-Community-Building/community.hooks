We would like to organise events in a responsible way in Heidelberg

How to deal with the problem of getting insurance cover for our in-person events?

Current results:

2025-01-23: We had a meetup, and talked about the topic "Veranstaltungen in der Kurf√ºrstenanlage 58 verantwortungsvoll organisieren": https://www.meetup.com/urban-innovation-stadt-neu-denken/events/305760996/

2025-01-26: We have a few good ideas, and work on the topic internally. 

Get in touch with us at one of our Meetups to get involved in the discussions.
