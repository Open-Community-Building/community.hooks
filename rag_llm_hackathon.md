Council Insights Heidelberg  - Data Analytics on Council Work using LLM

We are organizing a series of RAG LLM Hackathons 

The first was on Saturday February 1st 2025, and the next is to be decided later. (Maybe on the 15th of March 2025)

It is a low-key event, and managing it in a Github document is done on purpose. I will continue to explain it better here: https://github.com/Open-Community-Building/community.hooks/edit/main/README.md

Use your usual Git tools to work together with us!
