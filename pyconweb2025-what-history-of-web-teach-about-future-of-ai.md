I've visited Pycon+Web 2025, and took some notes on talks that I saw:

The talk by Ines was a great Keynote for this conference!

> What The History of the Web Can Teach Us About the Future of AI
> 
> Ines Montani
> 
> Founder at Explosion.AI, core developer of spaCy and Prodigy
> 
> https://www.pyconweb.com/activity/what-history-of-web-teach-about-future-of-ai
> 
> What lessons can we draw from that transformative era to better understand the trajectory of AI? 
> This talk explores parallels between the evolution of the web and the rapid advancements in AI, 
> highlighting key trends, pitfalls, and opportunities that can guide us as we shape the future of artificial intelligence.

Ines powered through her talk, and fired off many ideas left and right. 

I am still processing the input, and have slowly managed to get a full picture by looking up the references.
