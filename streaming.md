Current Status:

We have a rough idea of how to make video streaming, but we still lack a lot of experience!
The good thing is that we are not afraid to learn new things, and that this is exactly
your chance to jump in help us out! Join us in our adventure!

Todos:

- We are going to experiment with live straming to Youtube and Twitch

- Describe the current hardware we have gathered in detail

- Plan next week's Meetup full of cool talks
