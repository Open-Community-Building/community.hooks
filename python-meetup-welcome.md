Have a look at the Meetup description to see where it happens.

The last Tuesday of the month, the meetup happens at Dezernat 16:

The events are public for the most part.

Sometimes, we reserve a place for an hour or so to work on progamming tasks together, and this is then invite only.

We always need people to get involved!

The meetings are in english. Sometimes we may switch to another language though if it seems appropriate.
