Open Community Building

To get in touch with us, we get together every Saturday at 11 o'clock here at the Team Bib Lab meeting:

https://github.com/Open-Community-Building/community.hooks/blob/main/team-bib-lab.md

To stay up-to-date on our topics, we keep a record of what is currently going on.

Have a look at the files in this folder to get an idea of what we are up to.

People we reach through our posts on social media want to know 

- what happens to the topics we talk about?

- what are the results so far?

- is the topic closed, or still ongoing?

- what are some interesting links?

- further information

Let me explain the rationale:

If I post this event on any social media platform, I am giving away control over it.

Why not just post it in a simple text file in Github and use the tools we love and cherish?

For the moment, I am fine to give control to Github, but I have some ideas about how to make the links redirect through a domain controlled by a friendly organisation. Then, if Github should make it difficult to link to it, I can redirect somewhere else.
