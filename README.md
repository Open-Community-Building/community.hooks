Open Community Building

To stay up-to-date on our topics, we keep a record of what is currently going on.

Have a look at the files in this folder to get an idea of what we are up to.

People we reach through our posts on social media want to know 

- what happens to the topics we talk about?

- what are the results so far?

- is the topic closed, or still ongoing?

- what are some interesting links?

- further information

To see how this works in action when we want to get people hooked:

In the comments, there is a link to the hooks.

Now those who are interested know about the current state of affairs.
